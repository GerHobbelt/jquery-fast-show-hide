# jquery-fast-show-hide

fast, styleable version of `$el.hide()`, `$el.show()` and `$el.toggle()`: using classes rather than direct manipulation of the DOM element(s) `.style` attributes.

## Notes

Run `npm run less` to compile the example LESS stylesheet. This of course requires you to have a working LESS compiler installed globally, e.g. by previously running `npm install -g less`.
